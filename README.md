# UORG_2023
UORG_2023 Third_party

This repository includes codes for UORG2023. To test first mission code, you will need to adjust connect of string of vehicle according to SITL simulation connection.
Also first mission needs a proper world to simulate and get the camera feed. We used Airsim-UnrealEngine4 environment for simulations. 
Second mission could be simulated easily with only SITL. Connection string needs to be modified also.
